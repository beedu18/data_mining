# data_mining
Implementing data mining algorithms from scratch

## Environment
Python: 3.7.x

## Dependencies
Matplotlib: 3.0.x

### Algorithms
* K-Means (Clustering)
* K-Medoids (Clustering)
* DBSCAN (Clustering)
* Apriori (Association Rule Mininig)
* Naive Bayesian Classifier (Classifiaction)

All of these are assorted in the [Algos.py](https://github.com/beedu18/data_mining/blob/master/Algos.py) file

A test code comparing k-means and dbscan is written in the [driver.py](https://github.com/beedu18/data_mining/blob/master/driver.py) file
